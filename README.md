      reqresAPIAutomatedTests is an automated project with aim objective is verify the API work correctly, validating response code, response time, response data and the       parameters sent.
  - **Why the language and tools selected**
  	The language used is JavaScript   and the tool was Cypress that technology was selected by followign reasons:

  - **How to develop for it**
	  1. Review the endpoint using Postman - (doing manual smoke test)
	  2. Identify the tools that can be used for automating
	  3. Select the tool following the next criteria (Time for automation, knowledge and future improvements)
	  4.  After defined the tool, Create the structure
	  5. Finally, I added the test cases for every requirement

  - **Future improvements**
  1. Add Async functions
  2. Integrate the automation tests in the CI/CD
  3. Improve the structure following a partner
  4. Add test cases where verify other request (Patch, Delete, Authorization...)
